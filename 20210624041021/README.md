# Only POSIX Shell Language Covered Deeply

There just isn't time to get into all of the other programming languages
deeply within the time frame of the Beginner Boost. But we will talk
about all of the modern languages in terms of their best intended usage
as well as their individual problems. Then you can better decide which
languages you want to learn and take it from there. We will be doing
boosts for a few specific languages:

* Bash
* C
* Go
* Perl
* Python
