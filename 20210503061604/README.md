# May the 4th Be With You

It seemed appropriate to pick a day that celebrates a relatively good
story about how people learn the most effectively, from one human to
another. However, it's worth noting that Master/Apprentice learning is
not what we do here. While that's an effective way to learn a very
specific skill set like martial arts where all the techniques and
concepts are built on a common set of principles, mentored learning is
more about the person learning *being* the master. The mentor is a guide
and assistant in the process, but the learner is the boss of their own
learning and always will be.
