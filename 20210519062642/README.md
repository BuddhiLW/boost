# No Multi-User System Topics Covered

The Boost is primarily intended to boost an individual into productivity
with their own computer with one or more containers installed.
Therefore, the traditional topics related to multi-user systems do not
apply, but can certainly be the first thing people learn after they
complete the boost. Indeed, very few systems these days have more than
one user account on them, if even that.

However, it is still critical that people understand the distinction of
permissions and root access to systems in order to create safe
containers, programs, and systems, zero-trust, as they say.
