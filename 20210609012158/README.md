# Only Enough Structured Data to Customize

Structured data is a huge category of learning. Unfortunately, a minimal
amount is required before any substantial terminal customization can
take place (which holds for shell scripting as well). For example, most
applications store their configurations in JSON or YAML format. Regular
expressions and pattern matching are a fundamental part of editing with
Vi/m in any meaningful way, as well as creating any integration scripts
and plugins.

However, other structured data concepts and formats are *not* required
to get going. Indeed, some *never* need to be learned by some technical
professions. SQL, for example, is critical in many fields and completely
unnecessary in others (even though web developers will try and convince
you that it is mandatory learning. It's just not.) XML is another. So is
Protobuf.
