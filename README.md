# Beginner Boosts

*Old Boost content is
[here](https://github.com/rwxrob/boost/tree/old-20210722) while I work
on this new organization that is free from any schedule (days).*

Beginner boosts are meant to give you a push toward your own
self-directed learning goals. They are my highly opinionated answer to
the frequently asked question, "What should I learn?" 

Be warned, this stuff changes daily, sometimes hourly.

0.  Learn Like a Hacker
1.  Contain the Crazy with Docker
2.  [Peace, Love, and Linux Terminal][terminal]
3.  Become Badass with Bash
4.  Can I Has Internetz?
5.  Go Big with Golang
6.  Get Good to Gig

[terminal]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/linux-terminal-native>

My boosts are definitely flavored for hacking and infrastructure
operations (what dumb-ass "full stack" web morons --- Torvaldz refuses
to call them "developers" --- have decided to call "back end").  For
example, we study web languages and protocols, not so much to make
shitty GUI web apps, but to understand how then work and
why learning the bash Linux shell allows us to *dominate* them. We do
learn, however, to make minimal doc sites for notes and such.

I personally would also like to add the following (once and when I learn
them):

* Create Native Mobile Android Apps
* Use Machine Learning Models
* Create Machine Learning Models
* Program C for Embedded Devices

## A Warning About My Opinions and Attitude

Some don't like my opinions, answers, and attitude. That's fine. But
*my* forums and material are not a place for dissent. When learning a
martial art you start with a particular style or school and stick with
it a while before deciding to go your own way. There are lots of skills
and concepts that intertwine to provide the overall value. For example,
Vim + Bash + TMUX *must* be used together (in my style). Evaluating any
one of them alone would be wrong.

No one if forcing you follow these boosts and content. That is your
choice, but if you *do* choose to do so, I require you stick with it
long enough to make an educated decision when you decide to deviate from
it after you have learned it. You can leave anytime, of course.

The biggest reason for this is because it has become painfully obvious
that people simply do not understand the most important concept upon
which *all* of this is built: the UNIX philosophy.

I have spent thousands of hours on this content and have demonstrated I
am willing to change when provided with new *substantial* information. I
*will* change my methods and content when better ways are revealed *with
which I agree*. Disagreement is fine. Just don't confuse anyone in any
of *my* forums by suggesting --- again, in *my* forums --- to use things
that I have openly recommended against. For example, recommending any of
the following *to any beginner* in my Twitch channel or YouTube comments
--- even in trolling jest --- will get your banned without appeal:

* Neo-fucking-Vim
* Arch Linux
* Zsh
* EMACS
* Rust
* Docker Swarm
* Docker Compose
* Podman
* Minikube

You've been warned.

Please do not misunderstand, we want people to become autodidacts and
select their own path. We just don't want to confuse them early on
either. When it becomes unclear what my suggestion is --- because so many
are opposed to it and voicing it in *my* forums --- I get really annoyed
is all. It wastes the limited volunteer time I have to expend on this
effort.

There is nothing wrong with stating what you use and why when directly
asked. But, again, if it is my forum please state my position first,
then yours.

I encourage people to reach out to people individually, using your own
communications channels and forums to make those dissenting opinions,
which I encourage. It is also okay to disagree in my forum by first
clearly stating my position on it first and *why* you disagree. I just
*hate* wasting time when beginners get confused by 20 different opinions
in *my* forum.
