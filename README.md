# Beginner Boosts

*Old Boost content is
[here](https://github.com/rwxrob/boost/tree/old-20210722) while I work
on this new organization that is free from any schedule (days).*

Be warned, this stuff changes daily, sometimes hourly. I'm in the middle
or creating new content while exploring a new writing method. Follow
these specific zettels if you want to monitor my progress:

## Older Stuff

The following was what I had here before I embarked on creating the
written content using the Zettelkasten CYOA method.

0.  Contain the Crazy with Docker
2.  [Peace, Love, and Linux Terminal][terminal]
    0. Thou Shalt Follow UNIX Philosophy
    1. Navigate Linux Bash Command Line
    2. Edit Text with `ed`/`ex`/`vi`/`vim`
    3. Code Basic `bash` Filters for Structured Data
    4. Multiplex with `screen` and `tmux`
    5. Get Answers with `man` and `lynx`/`w3m`
    6. Configure and Customize
    7. Manage Source with `git`, `gh` (GitHub)
0.  Learn Like a Hacker
3.  Can I Has Internetz?
4.  Become Bada\$\$ with Bash
5.  Go Big with Go
6.  Get Good to Gig

My boosts are definitely flavored for hacking and infrastructure
operations (including "cloud-native"). For example, we study web
languages and protocols, not so much to make GUI web apps, but to
understand how then work and why learning the bash Linux shell allows us
to *dominate* them. We do learn, however, to make minimal doc sites for
notes and such.

I personally would also like to add the following (once and when I learn
them):

* Create Native Mobile Android Apps
* Use Machine Learning Models
* Create Machine Learning Models
* Program C for Embedded Devices

## A Warning About My Opinions and Attitude

Some don't like my opinions, answers, and attitude. That's fine. But
*my* forums and material are not a place for dissent. When learning a
martial art you start with a particular style or school and stick with
it before deciding to go your own way. There are lots of skills
and concepts that intertwine to provide the overall value. For example,
Ed/Vim + Bash + TMUX *must* be used together. Evaluating any one of them
alone would be wrong. No one is forcing you follow these boosts and
content. That is your choice, but if you *do* choose to do so, I require
you stick with it long enough to make an educated decision. You can
leave anytime, of course.

Please do not misunderstand, we want people to become autodidacts and
select their own path. We just don't want to confuse them early on
either. When it becomes unclear what my suggestion is --- because so many
are opposed to it and voicing it in *my* forums --- I get really annoyed
is all. It wastes the limited volunteer time I have to expend on this
effort.
