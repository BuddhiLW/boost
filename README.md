# Beginner Boost

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red.svg)

Every [May the 4th] I hold a free series of live-recorded *Beginner
Boost* sessions on [Twitch] and [YouTube] that run through the end of July
(or so). Below is the outline of current and planned content. This is a
living document; it changes from day to day --- even hour to hour ---
[like software].

> ðŸŒŸ You may want to *Watch* this GitHub repo to be notified of updates and
changes. A *Star* would be nice as well. If you want to contribute open
an *Issue* to discuss it. Much of the content will be drawn from my
[personal Zettelkasten repo] and my [learning labs] (which you might
also want to watch for changes, but they are not always Boost related).
You can also help fund this project by clicking *Sponsor*. Thanks.

# Deal with Data, In a Structured Way

*Remember purpose of Boost is not to cover in depth, but to give a sense
of what you need to know and why. Mastering these topics (SQL, for
example) could take several months alone, writing your own language
grammar in PEGN, a year or more*

## <a id=day20> Day 20: Understand the Need for Structured Data

1. What is Data?
1. Evolution of Data Utilization
1. Delimited Data (WS, Tab, Bar, Paths, CSV)
1. Universal JSON, YAML, and JSON-Schema Data
1. Pattern Matching (Globbing, Globstar)
1. Matching and Parsing with Regular Expressions

Other important structured data formats to know:

* gRPC and ProtoBuf
* Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)
* ABNF, EBNF, PEG, and PEGN Specification Languages
* Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Markdown
* INI and TOML
* HTML
* XML

## <a id=day21> Day 21: Delimited Data (Space, Tab, Bar, Paths, CSV)

1. Describe Differences Between Delimited Data Formats
1. Name Common Applications and Uses of Delimited Data
1. Know the Different Forms of *White Space* 
1. Know the Difference Between `PATH` and File Path 
1. Use Parameter Expansion to Get Prefix and Suffix
1. Use `cut` To Get At Stuff In The Middle (But Careful, Not Greedy)
1. Use `awk` If You Really Want (But You Don't Need It)
1. Use `tr` or `sed` to Change the Delimiter or "Squeeze" (Spaces, etc.)
1. Understand Input Field Separator (IFS) (Maybe use `()`)
1. Understand the Problems with CSV (Not the Source Manager)

## <a id=day22> Day 22: Universal JSON, YAML, JSON-Schema Data

1. What is JSON and Why Does it Matter?
   1. JSON is for Parsing, Not People
   1. "Should I Use JSON5?" HELL NO!
1. What is YAML and Why Does it Matter?
   1. YAML is for People and Programming
1. Know the Definition of *Schema*
1. Know the Definition of *Domain Model*
1. Use `jq`/`yq` to Parse and Output JSON/YAML Data
   1. Install `jq` with `sudo apt install jq`
   1. Install `yq` However
   1. Always Surround Query in Single Quotes

## <a id=day23> Day 23: Pattern Matching (Globbing, Globstar)

1. Use `shopt` to Activate Pattern Matching in Bash Shell
1. Use `*` to Match Zero or More of Anything
1. Use `**/` to Descend Into All Directories as Well
1. Use `?` to Match Exactly One of Anything
1. Use `{foo,bar}` to Match `foo` or `bar`
1. Use `[a-c]` to Match `a`, `b`, or `c` (Like `{a,b,c}`)
1. Use `[^a-c]` Match *Anything But* `a`,`b`, or `c`
