# Beginner Boosts

*Old Boost content is
[here](https://github.com/rwxrob/boost/tree/old-20210722) while I work
on this new organization that is free from any schedule (days).*

Beginner boosts are meant to give you a push down your own self-directed
learning path. They are my highly opinionated answer to the frequently
asked question, "What should I learn?" Be warned, this stuff changes
daily, sometimes hourly.

0.  Learn and Think Like a Hacker
1.  Use Docker Desktop and Containers
2.  [Live and Code in the Linux Terminal][terminal]
3.  Create Terminal Apps Quickly in Go
4.  Create Docker Container Images
5.  Create Kubernetes Applications
6.  Deploy and Maintain Infrastructure
7.  Administer Kubernetes Clusters
8.  Create Progressive Web Apps
9.  Leverage Google Cloud Platform

I personally would also like to add the following (once and when I learn
them):

* Create Native Mobile Android Apps
* Use Machine Learning Models
* Create Machine Learning Models
* Program C for Embedded Devices

The reason for “no derivatives” CC requirement is to preserve the
consistency of opinions throughout the content since attribution is
required. Without it, forks with changed opinions and resource listings
could be purposefully or accidentally taken as the opinions of the
original author. This is simply too dangerous to allow. The “no
derivatives” clause protects against the inevitable “consensus” problem
that plagues community-created content. That said, please reach out by
