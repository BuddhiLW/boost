# Beginner Boost

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red.svg)

Every [May the 4th] I hold a free series of live-recorded *Beginner
Boost* sessions on [Twitch] and [YouTube] that run through the end of July
(or so). Below is the outline of current and planned content. This is a
living document; it changes from day to day --- even hour to hour ---
[like software].

> ðŸŒŸ You may want to *Watch* this GitHub repo to be notified of updates and
changes. A *Star* would be nice as well. If you want to contribute open
an *Issue* to discuss it. Much of the content will be drawn from my
[personal Zettelkasten repo] and my [learning labs] (which you might
also want to watch for changes, but they are not always Boost related).
