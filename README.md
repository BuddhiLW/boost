# Linux Terminal Beginner Boost

*Old Boost content is
[here](https://github.com/rwxrob/boost/tree/old-20210722) while I work
on this new organization that is free from any schedule (days).*

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red.svg)

Get started right. Become a shell native. Here’s what we’ll learn:

0. RWX Method and Values
1. Docker for Developers
2. Leveraging Linux Containers
3. Linux Bash Command Line
4. Bash Scripting with Ed/Vim
5. Screen and TMUX Multiplexers
6. W3M, Lynx, and Curl for Web
7. Git, GitHub, and Docker Hub
8. Data, Markdown, and Pandoc
9. Go Command Line Programming

This is the way.


## Purpose

The purpose of the Boost is to help you learn to use your most powerful
tech asset: your computer running Linux in a container. There’s no
“teaching” going on here, just learning. We will cover what to learn and
some suggestions about where and how to learn it. The rest is up to you
and the community here to support you, as it should be. Some call this
“the hard way,” but really it’s the only way. Learning happens in the
lab, not the lecture hall.

The reason for “no derivatives” CC requirement is to preserve the
consistency of opinions throughout the content since attribution is
required. Without it, forks with changed opinions and resource listings
could be purposefully or accidentally taken as the opinions of the

that plagues community-created content. That said, please reach out by
