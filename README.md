# Beginner Boost

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red.svg)

Below is the outline of current and planned content. This is a living
document; it changes from day to day --- even hour to hour --- [like
software].

[like software]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/search?q=knowledge%20as%20source>

> ðŸŒŸ You may want to *Watch* this GitHub repo to be notified of updates and
changes. A *Star* would be nice as well. If you want to contribute open
an *Issue* to discuss it. Much of the content will be drawn from my
[personal Zettelkasten repo] and my [learning labs] (which you might
also want to watch for changes, but they are not always Boost related).
