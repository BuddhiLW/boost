## Purpose

The purpose of the Boost is to help you learn to use your most powerful
tech asset: your computer running Linux in a container. There’s no
“teaching” going on here, just learning. We will cover what to learn and
some suggestions about where and how to learn it. The rest is up to you
and the community here to support you, as it should be. Some call this
“the hard way,” but really it’s the only way.

that plagues community-created content. That said, please reach out by
