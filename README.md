# Beginner Boost

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red.svg)

Every May the 4th, we hold a *Beginner Boost* to push young (and old)
Padawans off in the right technical direction lest they become
overwhelmed by the dark side (which contrary to popular opinion isn't
*just* "full stack" development). The world needs more skilled Jedi
fighting the war for [open source] and [open knowledge] and we are hear
to help.

[open source]: <https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=open source> 
[open knowledge]: <https://keg.sh>

Below is the outline of current and planned content. This is a living
document; it changes from one day to the next, you know, like software.
Knowledge source is actually very similar to source code, which is why
all this is on GitHub. You will probably want to *Watch* it to be
notified of updates and changes. A *Star* would be nice as well. If you
want to contribute open an *Issue* to discuss it.
