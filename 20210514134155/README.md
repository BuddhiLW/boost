# The Beginning is Uncomfortable on Purpose

Getting feedback that the first few days of boost are tough to get
through for all sort of reasons. I agree. I actually planned that a
little by design. I want people to understand what they are getting into
so they can leave immediately if this method and my personal style and
ethics and views and values aren't in line with theirs. There's nothing
wrong with saying, "Oh my God, I cannot stand to listen to this guy" and
finding someone else who "clicks" with them.

For example, I was just reading about a [lawyer turned Google
engineer][shit] (yeah, he's actually proud of that) giving learning and
career advice and I wanted to track him down, and punch him in his
fucking "5 Dos, 5 Don'ts", sound-bite, self-promoting, inauthentic,
show-me-the-money, saccharin, side-show face. The dude is fucking bad
for humanity. But that's just my opinion. I'm sure all the
"motivational" speakers on Reddit and TED-talkers will *love* him. So if
that is you, stay the fuck away from me and my Beginner Boost. In fact,
make *sure* you don't learn anything ever. I want you to fail big time.
There. I said it.

> It's no surprise that the completely broken
freeCodeCamp people are all friendly with this asshole. You know, the
school principle who took a one-month "front end" bootcamp and created
an entire "educational" site that focuses on all the wrong things in all
the worst ways with *zero* industry experience or backing.
