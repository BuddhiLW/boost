# Terminal and Container Centric

This boost is *not* for people looking for "front-end" or "full
stack" web or mobile development. Go someplace else.

This boost will have you spending almost all your time in the terminal
working in multiple containers. If that appeals to you then you are in
the right place. If it doesn't, go away.
